This great book gives a thorough introduction to the field of Statistical/Machine Learning. The book is available for download (see link below), but I think this is one of those books that is definitely worth buying. The book contains sections with applications in R based on public datasets available for download or which are part of the <A target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/index.html">R-package ISLR</A>. Furthermore, there is a Stanford University online course based on this book and taught by the authors (See <A target="_blank" href='https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/'>course catalogue</A> for current schedule).<P>
